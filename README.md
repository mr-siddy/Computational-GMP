### Biot-Sevart Law Visualisation

The Biotâ€“Savart law is used for computing the resultant [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) **B** at position **r** in 3D-space generated by a flexible [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) *I* (for example due to a wire). A steady (or stationary) current is a continual flow of [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge) which does not change with time and the charge neither accumulates nor depletes at any point. The law is a physical example of a [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral), being evaluated over the path *C* in which the electric currents flow (e.g. the wire).
